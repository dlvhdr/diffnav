## Installation

Homebrew:

brew install dlvhdr/formulae/diffnav
```

Go:

```sh
go install github.com/dlvhdr/diffnav@latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> To get the icons to render properly you should download and install a Nerd font from https://www.nerdfonts.com/. Then, select that font as your font for the terminal.
>
> _You can install these with brew as well: `brew install --cask font-<FONT NAME>-nerd-font`_

## Usage

### Pipe into diffnav

- `git diff | diffnav`
- `gh pr diff https://github.com/dlvhdr/gh-dash/pull/447 | diffnav`

### Set up as global git diff pager

```bash
git config --global pager.diff diffnav
```

## Configuration

- Currently you can configure `diffnav` only through delta so [check out their docs](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/configuration.html).
- If you want the exact configuration I'm using - [it can be found here](https://github.com/dlvhdr/diffnav/blob/main/cfg/delta.conf).

## Under the hood

`diffnav` uses:

* [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for the TUI
* [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for viewing the diffed file

Screenshots use:

* [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) for the terminal
* [tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) for the color scheme
* [CommitMono](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for the font
